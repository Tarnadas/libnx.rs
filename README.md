# libnx.rs

Very WIP toolchain for Rust on the Nintendo Switch. Requires the Rust fork at https://github.com/leo60228/rust/tree/horizon and the backtrace-rs fork at https://github.com/leo60228/backtrace-rs/tree/horizon. Build using [cargo-nro](https://github.com/MegatonHammer/linkle). Xargo.toml only exists because of my setup for building homebrew, you can probably just use a normal cross compiler.
